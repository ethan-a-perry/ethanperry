            <p class="with-border-top margin-top-1">Writing is another core part of my workâ€”it helps me process and clarify my thoughts, opinions, and ideas. On this site, you'll find a mix of my professional projects, technical experiments, and SaaS ventures, alongside my writing, including essays, book reviews, coding tutorials, poems, and more.</p>
