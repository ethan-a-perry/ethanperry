# ethan-perry.com

Welcome to the source code for my [personal website](https://ethan-perry.com), where I share my recent projects,
work, writing, and more.

Built with Astro and deployed on Cloudflare Pages (for now).

I used the following tools:

- Astro
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Cloudflare Pages (deployment)
- Airtable (to store contact form submissions)
- Figma
- Markdoc

My goal was to create a very simple, modern design.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/ethan-a-perry/ethanperry.git
    cd ethanperry
    ```
2. Install dependencies
    ```shell
    npm install
    ```
3. Start the development server
    ```shell
    npm run dev
    ```
4. Visit http://localhost:4321 (or whichever port Astro chooses)

## Build

1. Generate a full static build (the build files are output to the dist/ folder).
    ```shell
    npm run build
    ```
2. You can preview the production build locally with:
    ```shell
    npm run preview
    ```
