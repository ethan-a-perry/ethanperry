# ethan-perry.com

Welcome to the source code for my [personal website](https://ethan-perry.com), where I share my recent projects,
work, writings, and more.

I built this website with Astro and deployed it on Cloudflare Pages (for now).

I used the following tools:
* Astro
* JavaScript
* TypeScript
* HTML
* CSS
* Cloudflare Pages (deployment)
* Airtable (to store contact form submissions)
* Figma
* Markdoc

My goal was to create a design that felt modern, but also simple and not overstated.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/ethan-a-perry/ethanperry.git
    cd ethanperry
    ```
2. Install dependencies
    ```shell
   npm install
3. Start the development server
    ```shell
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Visit http://localhost:4321 (or whichever port Astro chooses)

## Build

1. Generate a full static build (the build files are output to the dist/ folder).
    ```shell
   npm run build
   ```
2. You can preview the production build locally with:
    ```shell
   npm run preview
   ```
